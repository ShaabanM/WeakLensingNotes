The most revolutionary discovery in cosmology since 
Hubble observed that the Universe is expanding is that 
this expansion is accelerating. A revelation that was 
awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize for its profound 
implications. \cite{nobel}. An accelerating
universe implies that either our understanding of gravity is flawed 
or that a mysterious pressure known as Dark Energy is driving the 
expansion \cite{peebles}.
This Dark Energy accounts for most (over 68\%) of the energy density in the observable universe, 
however its origin and physics are presently unknown \cite{planck}. 
As a result, the nature of Dark Energy is considered one of the 
greatest mysteries of modern science \cite{pathfinder}.

One of the most powerful techniques to probe Dark Energy and modified theories of gravity is weak lensing. Insert discription of weak lensing here \cite{hoekstra,rachel_2018}.
