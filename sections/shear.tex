The weak lensing analysis process can be conceptually split into two parts; 1) converting images to catalogs of galaxy shapes and 2) extracting scientific results from shape catalogs. In this section we present a sample image to catalog pipeline. 

\par \autoref{eq:ellip} indicates that we can measure the weak lensing effect A population of intrinsically round sources would therefore be ideal, but unfortunatelyreal  galaxies  have  an  average  intrinsic  ellipticity  of 0.25  per  component.Instead the lensing signal is inferred by averaging over an ensemble of sources, under theassumption that the unlensed orientations are random.
