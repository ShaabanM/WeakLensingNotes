\section{Notes}
In this section I present some general notes on weak lensing. 

\subsection{Talk Structure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Motivate The Problem Cosmo
    \item Introduce The Theory Cosmo + Lensing
    \item Explain How Theory Solves The Problem
    \item Current Results/ Experiments
    \item Explain Problems with WeakLensing
    \item Summarise
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Motivate The Problem}
Discuss probing the large scale universe with CMB, supernvae, clustering
and lensing. 
Note weak lensing makes no assumptions about the nature of dark matter
and no assumptions about relationship between visible matter and mass therefore
it provides a directly measured mass distribution in the universe as a function of 
redshift. Therefore we can get info on DE and DM directly. It is sensitive to intial
conditions so it can even give info on inflation. 

\subsection{Lensing Basics}
\subsubsection{Lens Equations}
\begin{equation}
    \vec{\beta} = \vec{\theta} - \vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{\pi}  \int d^2\theta'  \kappa(\vec{\theta'}) \frac{\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta'}}{|\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta'}|^2}
    \label{eq:}
\end{equation}
